# TicTacToe

## About
This project has been developed with the aim to practise C++ in an introductory way, and also serves as a way to practise git itself. Please, consider this project as an academic project with the sole purpose of learn this language.

This is a terminal game, so it only can be played in macOS and Linux platforms, due to the need to alter the terminal configuration using `termios`, only available in POSIX systems.

## Build
Just run:
```
clang++ -o TicTacToe main.cpp game.cpp
```
or
```
g++ -o TicTacToe main.cpp game.cpp
```
